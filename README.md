# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### 1. Overview of Pewlett Hackard Analysis:
#### After querying our newly created database and summarizing information, we have a new task to tackle. We want to query our data to gather the likely employees who will be retiring as well as those who are eligible for a mentorship program.

### 2. Pewlett Hackard Analysis Results:
Below is a table that summarizes down ride-share data for total rides, total drivers and total fares, along with average fare per driver and ride.

To visualize the above information, we added three pie carts:

We also wanted to add a bit of time series plots to help see total fares by week over the course of the first few months of the year.

 ### 3 Summary:
#### 
 1. The forth week of Feburary has a jump in fares across all city types. We can establish a driver incentive to continue this trend in every city type for this week. 
 
 2. Sububurban areas make up ~30% of all fares but only have ~16% of the total drivers. It's possible the fares in suburban areas can be higher but there lacks drivers. We can make a push to increase the driver count in suburban cities. 
 
 3. Urban areas drive the business and currently there is no shortage of drivers, however, the average fare/ride is ~$24 and could discourage riders from using the service. Lowering the fares slightly might help incease the amount of rides in Urban areas.
